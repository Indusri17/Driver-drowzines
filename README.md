Driver Drowsiness Detection
This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It aims to improve road safety by monitoring the driver’s eye and facial behavior to detect signs of fatigue or inattention.

🎯 Objective
To alert the driver when signs of drowsiness—such as prolonged eye closure or yawning—are detected, potentially preventing accidents caused by fatigue.

🔍 Features
Real-time video stream analysis

Eye aspect ratio (EAR) for blink detection

Mouth aspect ratio (MAR) for yawn detection

Alarm sound when drowsiness is detected
